# better-video-splitter.nut
Edited version of Valve's video-splitter.nut for Portal 2. Changes made to improve usability and customization!

Valve's video splitter is very robust, but it only really works easily in Valve's own maps. I had a lot of trouble using video-splitter.nut, so I thought I'd edit chunks of it to make it more user friendly. Enjoy!
